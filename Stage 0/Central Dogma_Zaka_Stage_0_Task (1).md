**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

 

** **

**Introduction:**

Central dogma of molecular biology explains the process of transcription (formation of RNA from DNA) and translation (formation of protein from RNA) that how flow of genetic information takes place in a biological system. The theory of Central Dogma of  Molecular Biology was first stated by Francis Crick in 1957 and published in 1958(1). In 1970, he re-stated in a Nature paper: “The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information and such information can not be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid”(2). Biomarkers are the measurable indicators used for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. DNA, RNA and proteins all can be a source for the cancer biomarkers and that is why central dogma plays key role in cancer research, diagnosis and prognosis.

 

**Explanation:**

There can be nine different possibilities for the transfer of biological sequential information which involves the information transfer from; (i) DNA to DNA, (ii) DNA to RNA, (iii) RNA to protein, (iv) RNA to RNA, (v) RNA to protein, (vi) protein to DNA, (vii) protein to RNA, (viii) protein to protein and (ix) DNA to protein.

General transfers include DNA replications, transcription and translation. DNA replication is the most fundamental step in preservation and transfer of genetic information which involves the formation of complementary DNA strand from parent strand by an enzyme known as DNA Polymerase. Transcription is a process in which genetic information present in DNA is replicated by RNA Polymerase into new strand of mRNA. By using the information present in mRNA, ribosomes assemble amino acids and form protein in a process called Translation.

 

<!--[if !supportLists]-->**(b)** <!--[endif]-->**Special transfers of biological sequential information:**

It involves the formation of DNA strand from an RNA strand (Reverse Transcription) by Reverse Transcriptase enzyme and RNA synthesis from an RNA template (RNA Replication) by group of enzymes RNA-dependant RNA polymerases. In test tubes, direct translation from DNA to protein has also been observed.

<!--[if !supportLists]-->**(c)** <!--[endif]-->**Unknown transfers of biological information:**

Transfer of information from proteins to proteins, proteins to DNA and proteins to RNA has neither been observed yet in intact cells nor in test tubes.

 

**Central Dogma, Biomarkers and their Role in Cancer:**

Cancer biomarkers are biological molecules which can be of  DNA, RNA or proteins origin which help in the detection of cancer and provide information about prognosis. For example; BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations act as biomarkers for Breast and Ovarian Cancer. Small non-coding RNAs such as micro RNAs (miRNAs) are RNA based potential biomarkers. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a protein which acts as a biomarker for Prostate Cancer. Comprehensive knowledge of Genomics, Transcriptomics and Proteomics helps in the cancer biomarker discovery.

 

Micro RNAs are found to be involved in gene expression regulation in cancer. A research shown that in non-small Lung Cancer samples, miR-486-5p was significantly downregulated(3). PIK3R1 gene was the target of miR-486-5p. Similarly, miR-153 was found to be involved in Bladder Cancer (BCA) prognosis(4). Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) can also serve as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy(5).

**Conclusion:**

The basic concept of central dogma of molecular biology, which explains the way genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins, is critical for comprehending biological processes and has significant implications for the study of cancer. The central dogma offers the basis for identifying genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes in cancer cells by explaining the transcription, translation, and replication processes in detail. These alterations act as biomarkers that are crucial to prognosis, and detection of cancer. Novel biomarkers, such as non-coding RNAs and proteins, offer crucial pathways for early detection and tailored therapeutics in cancer treatment. Ultimately, central dogma plays key role in our understanding of cancer genomics, paving the way to more personalized and effective cancer treatment.
